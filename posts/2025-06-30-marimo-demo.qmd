## Introduction

This post demonstrates the power of [Marimo](https://marimo.io/), a reactive Python notebook that integrates beautifully with Quarto. Unlike traditional notebooks, Marimo automatically updates cells when their dependencies change, creating a truly interactive experience.

## What Makes Marimo Special?

Marimo brings several advantages over traditional notebooks:

- **Reactive execution**: Cells automatically re-run when their inputs change
- **No hidden state**: Clean execution model prevents common notebook pitfalls  
- **Interactive UI elements**: Built-in widgets for creating interactive experiences
- **Reproducible**: Deterministic execution order ensures reproducibility
- **Pythonic**: Notebooks are valid Python scripts

## Interactive Demo

The notebook below showcases these features with interactive visualizations and data analysis:

```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Reactive Updates
Try adjusting the sliders in the notebook above - notice how all dependent visualizations update automatically without manually re-running cells.

### 2. Interactive Widgets
Marimo provides a rich set of UI elements:
- Sliders for numeric inputs
- Dropdowns for categorical selections  
- Text inputs, checkboxes, and more

### 3. Real-time Data Analysis
The linear regression example shows how you can explore data interactively, adjusting parameters and immediately seeing the impact on your analysis.

## Getting Started with Marimo

To use Marimo in your own projects:

1. Install marimo: `pip install marimo`
2. Create a new notebook: `marimo edit my_notebook.py`
3. Add the quarto-marimo extension: `quarto add marimo-team/quarto-marimo`
4. Include your notebook in Quarto documents using the `{marimo}` code block

## Conclusion

Marimo represents an exciting evolution in computational notebooks, bringing reactive programming concepts to data science workflows. Its integration with Quarto makes it perfect for creating interactive blog posts and documentation.

The combination of Marimo's interactivity with Quarto's publishing capabilities opens up new possibilities for sharing reproducible, engaging data science content.
